# Customer Directrix Response Scripts

Run `Data_Maker.m` first to create all desired datasets. A sample format and used datasets can be found in [Dataset Files](https://github.com/MonsiBoy/Customer-Directrix-Response/assets/71032235/c3afe0a5-e4fb-4a45-a373-4ac31cef9bc0). 

Once you have obtained the desired datasets ensure that `CDR_wCoalition.m` and the dataset files are within the same path.
