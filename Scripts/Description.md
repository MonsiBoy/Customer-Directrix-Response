# Customer Directrix Response Scripts

Run `Data_Maker.m` first to create all desired datasets. A sample format and used datasets can be found in [Dataset Files](https://github.com/MonsiBoy/Customer-Directrix-Response/tree/main/Dataset%20Files). 

Once you have obtained the desired datasets ensure that `CDR_wCoalition.m` and the dataset files are within the same path.
